# Connected Restaurant Chef Mobile App

## Project Overview

This project is a mobile application designed specifically for restaurant chefs to streamline the order management process in a connected restaurant environment.

## Features

- **Tablet Interface for Chefs**:  
  The chef uses a tablet device in the kitchen, which serves as their main interface for daily operations.

- **Real-Time Order Reception**:  
  As customers place their orders through the restaurant’s system, the orders are instantly sent to the chef’s tablet. Each new order appears in real-time, ensuring the chef is always up to date with the latest requests.

- **Order Consultation**:  
  The chef can easily view all active orders on the tablet. Each order includes all necessary details such as table number, ordered items, special instructions, and time of order.

- **Order Status Management**:  
  The chef has the ability to update the progress status of each order directly from the tablet. Typical statuses might include:  
    - Received  
    - In Preparation  
    - Ready to Serve  
   

  This feature helps the entire restaurant staff (including waiters and managers) track the real-time status of every order, improving communication and efficiency.

## Purpose

The main goal of this app is to enhance communication between the kitchen and the rest of the restaurant staff, reduce errors, and speed up the service by providing an intuitive and interactive digital solution for order management.

## Technologies

- Mobile app (tablet-oriented UI)
- Real-time data synchronization with the restaurant’s order system
